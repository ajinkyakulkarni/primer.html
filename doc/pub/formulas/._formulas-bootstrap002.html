<h1 id="sec:formula:glossary">Computer science glossary<a name="sec:formula:glossary"></a></h1>

<p>
It is now time to pick up some important words that programmers use
when they talk about programming: algorithm, application, assignment,
blanks (whitespace), bug, code, code segment, code snippet, debug,
debugging, execute, executable, implement, implementation, input,
library, operating system, output, statement, syntax, user, verify,
and verification.  These words are frequently used in English in lots
of contexts, yet they have a precise meaning in computer science.

<p>
<!-- ********* Terms Related to Develping Programs  *********** -->

<p>
<em>Program</em> and <em>code</em> are interchangeable terms.  A code/program
<em>segment</em> is a collection of consecutive statements from a program.
Another term with similar meaning is <em>code snippet</em>.  Many also use
the word <em>application</em> in the same meaning as program and code.  A
related term is <em>source code</em>, which is the same as the text that
constitutes the program.  You find the source code of a program in one
or more text files.  (Note that text files normally have the extension
<code>.txt</code>, while program files have an extension related to the
programming language, e.g., <code>.py</code> for Python programs. The content of
a <code>.py</code> file is, nevertheless, plain text as in a <code>.txt</code> file.)

<p>
We talk about <em>running a program</em>, or equivalently <em>executing a
program</em> or <em>executing a file</em>. The file we execute is the file in
which the program text is stored. This file is often called an
<em>executable</em> or an <em>application</em>.  The program text may appear in many
files, but the executable is just the single file that starts the
whole program when we run that file. Running a file can be done in
several ways, for instance, by double-clicking the file icon, by
writing the filename in a terminal window, or by giving the filename
to some program. This latter technique is what we have used so far in
this document: we feed the filename to the program <code>python</code>.  That is,
we execute a Python program by executing another program <code>python</code>,
which interprets the text in our Python program file.

<p>
The term <em>library</em> is widely used for a collection of generally useful
program pieces that can be applied in many different contexts. Having
access to good libraries means that you do not need to program code
snippets that others have already programmed (most probable in a
better way!).  There are huge numbers of Python libraries. In Python
terminology, the libraries are composed of <em>modules</em> and <em>packages</em>.
The section <a href="._formulas-bootstrap004.html#sec:formula:stdmath">Evaluating standard mathematical functions</a> gives a first glimpse of the <code>math</code>
module, which contains a set of standard mathematical functions for
\( \sin x \), \( \cos x \), \( \ln x \), \( e^x \), \( \sinh x \), \( \sin^{-1} x \),
etc. Later, you will meet many other useful modules. Packages are just
collections of modules. The standard Python distribution comes with a
large number of modules and packages, but you can download many more
from the Internet, see in particular <code>www.python.org/pypi</code>.  Very
often, when you encounter a programming task that is likely to occur
in many other contexts, you can find a Python module where the job is
already done. To mention just one example, say you need to compute how
many days there are between two dates. This is a non-trivial task that
lots of other programmers must have faced, so it is not a big surprise
that Python comes with a module <code>datetime</code> to do calculations with
dates.

<p>
The recipe for what the computer is supposed to do in a program is
called <em>algorithm</em>. In the examples in the first couple of chapters in
this document, the algorithms are so simple that we can hardly
distinguish them from the program text itself, but later in the
document we will carefully set up an algorithm before attempting to
<em>implement</em> it in a program. This is useful when the algorithm is much
more compact than the resulting program code.  The algorithm in the
current example consists of three steps:

<ul>
  <li> initialize the variables \( v_0 \), \( g \), and \( t \) with numerical values,</li>
  <li> evaluate \( y \) according to the formula <a href="._formulas-bootstrap001.html#mjx-eqn-1">(1)</a>,</li>
  <li> print the \( y \) value to the screen.</li>
</ul>

The Python program is very close to this text, but some less
experienced programmers may want to write the tasks in English before
translating them to Python.

<p>
The <em>implementation</em> of an algorithm is the process of writing and
testing a program. The testing phase is also known as <em>verification</em>:
After the program text is written we need to <em>verify</em> that the program
works correctly.  This is a very important step that will receive
substantial attention in the present document. Mathematical software
produce numbers, and it is normally quite a challenging task to verify
that the numbers are correct.

<p>
An <em>error</em> in a program is known as a <em>bug</em>, and the process of
locating and removing bugs is called <em>debugging</em>. Many look at
debugging as the most difficult and challenging part of computer
programming.
The origin of the strange terms bug and debugging can be found in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Etymology" target="_self">Wikipedia</a>.

<p>
Programs are built of <em>statements</em>.  There are many types of
statements:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">v0 <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">3</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
is an <em>assignment</em>
statement, while

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> y
</pre></div>
<p>
is a <em>print</em> statement.
It is common to have one statement on each line, but it is possible
to write multiple statements on one line if the statements are separated
by semi-colon. Here is an example:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">v0 <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">3</span>; g <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">9.81</span>; t <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.6</span>
y <span style="color: #666666">=</span> v0<span style="color: #666666">*</span>t <span style="color: #666666">-</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5*</span>g<span style="color: #666666">*</span>t<span style="color: #666666">**2</span>
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> y
</pre></div>
<p>
Although most newcomers to computer programming will think they
understand the meaning of the lines in the above program, it is
important to be aware of some major differences between notation in a
computer program and notation in mathematics.  When you see the
equality sign <code>=</code> in mathematics, it has a certain interpretation as
an equation (\( x+2=5 \)) or a definition (\( f(x)=x^2+1 \)).  In a computer
program, however, the equality sign has a quite different meaning, and
it is called an <em>assignment</em>.  The right-hand side of an assignment
contains an <em>expression</em>, which is a combination of values, variables,
and operators.  When the expression is <em>evaluated</em>, it results in a
value that the variable on the left-hand side will refer to. We often
say that the right-hand side value is <em>assigned</em> to the variable on
the left-hand side.  In the current context it means that we in the
first line assign the number 3 to the variable <code>v0</code>, 9.81 to <code>g</code>, and
0.6 to <code>t</code>.  In the next line, the right-hand side expression <code>v0*t -
0.5*g*t**2</code> is first evaluated, and the result is then assigned to the
<code>y</code> variable.

<p>
Consider the assignment statement

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">y <span style="color: #666666">=</span> y <span style="color: #666666">+</span> <span style="color: #666666">3</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
This statement is mathematically false, but in a program it just means
that we evaluate the right-hand side expression and assign its value
to the variable <code>y</code>. That is, we first take the current value of <code>y</code>
and add 3. The value of this operation is assigned to <code>y</code>.  The old
value of <code>y</code> is then lost.

<p>
You may think of the <code>=</code> as an arrow, <code>y &lt;- y+3</code>, rather than an
equality sign, to illustrate that the value to the right of the arrow
is stored in the variable to the left of the arrow. In fact, the R
programming language for statistical computing actually applies an
arrow, many old languages (like Algol, Simula, and Pascal) used <code>:=</code>
to explicitly state that we are not dealing with a mathematical
equality.

<p>
An example will illustrate the principle of assignment to a variable:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">y <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">3</span>
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> y
y <span style="color: #666666">=</span> y <span style="color: #666666">+</span> <span style="color: #666666">4</span>
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> y
y <span style="color: #666666">=</span> y<span style="color: #666666">*</span>y
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> y
</pre></div>
<p>
Running this program results in three numbers: <code>3</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>49</code>.
Go through the program and convince yourself that you understand what
the result of each statement becomes.

<p>
A computer program must have correct <em>syntax</em>, meaning that the text
in the program must follow the strict rules of the computer language
for constructing statements.  For example, the syntax of the print
statement is the word <code>print</code>, followed by one or more spaces,
followed by an expression of what we want to print (a Python variable,
text enclosed in quotes, a number, for instance).  Computers are very
picky about syntax! For instance, a human having read all the previous
pages may easily understand what this program does,

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">myvar <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">5.2</span>
prinnt Myvar
</pre></div>
<p>
but the computer will find two errors in the last line:
<code>prinnt</code> is an unknown instruction and <code>Myvar</code> is an undefined
variable. Only the first error is reported (a syntax error), because
Python stops the program once an error is found.
All errors that Python finds are easy to remove. The difficulty with
programming is to remove the rest of the errors, such as errors in
formulas or the sequence of operations.

<p>
<em>Blanks</em> may or may not be important in Python programs.  In
the document <a href="http://tcse6.on.net/looplist" target="_self">Loops and lists</a> <a href="._formulas-bootstrap009.html#Langtangen_TCSE6_looplist">[4]</a> you
will see that blanks are in some occasions essential for a correct
program.  Around <code>=</code> or arithmetic operators, however, blanks do not
matter. We could hence write our program from the section <a href="._formulas-bootstrap001.html#sec:formula:variables">Using variables</a> as

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">v0<span style="color: #666666">=3</span>;g<span style="color: #666666">=9.81</span>;t<span style="color: #666666">=0.6</span>;y<span style="color: #666666">=</span>v0<span style="color: #666666">*</span>t<span style="color: #666666">-0.5*</span>g<span style="color: #666666">*</span>t<span style="color: #666666">**2</span>;<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> y
</pre></div>
<p>
This is not a good idea because blanks are essential for easy reading
of a program code, and easy reading is essential for finding errors,
and finding errors is <em>the</em> difficult part of programming.  The
recommended layout in Python programs specifies one blank around <code>=</code>,
<code>+</code>, and <code>-</code>, and no blanks around <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>**</code>. Note that the
blank after <code>print</code> is essential: <code>print</code> is a command in Python and
<code>printy</code> is not recognized as any valid command.  (Python will
complain that <code>printy</code> is an undefined variable.)  Computer scientists
often use the term <em>whitespace</em> when referring to a blank. (To be more
precise, blank is the character produced by the space bar on the
keyboard, while whitespace denotes any character(s) that, if printed,
do not print ink on the paper: a blank, a tabulator character
(produced by backslash followed by t), or a newline character
(produced by backslash followed by n).  (The newline character is
explained in the section <a href="._formulas-bootstrap001.html#sec:formula:format">Formatting text and numbers</a>.)

<!-- ********** Terms Related to Using Programs *************** -->

<p>
When we interact with computer programs, we usually provide some
information to the program and get some information out.  It is common
to use the term <em>input data</em>, or just <em>input</em>, for the information
that must be known on beforehand.  The result from a program is
similarly referred to as <em>output data</em>, or just <em>output</em>.  In our
example, \( v_0 \), \( g \), and \( t \) constitute input, while \( y \) is
output. All input data must be assigned values in the program before
the output can be computed.
Input data can be explicitly initialized in the program, as we do in
the present example, or the data can be provided by user through
keyboard typing while the program is running.  Output data can be
printed in the terminal window, as in the current example, displayed
as graphics on the screen, or stored in a file for later access.

<p>
The word <em>user</em> usually has a special meaning in computer science: It
means a human interacting with a program.  You are a user of a text
editor for writing Python programs, and you are a user of your own
programs. When you write programs, it is difficult to imagine how
other users will interact with the program.  Maybe they provide wrong
input or misinterpret the output.  Making user-friendly programs is
very challenging and depends heavily on the target audience of
users. The author had the average reader of the book in mind as a
typical user when developing programs for this document.

<p>
A central part of a computer is the <em>operating system</em>.  This is
actually a collection of programs that manages the hardware and
software resources on the computer. There are three dominating operating
systems today on computers: Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
In addition, we have Android and iOS for handheld devices.
Several versions of Windows have appeared since the 1990s:
Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.  Unix
was invented already in 1970 and comes in many different versions.
Nowadays, two open source implementations of Unix, Linux and
Free BSD Unix, are most common. The latter forms the core of the Mac
OS X operating system on Macintosh machines, while Linux exists in
slightly different flavors: Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, and OpenSuse to
mention the most important distributions.  We will use the term Unix
in this document as a synonym for all the operating systems that
inherit from classical Unix, such as Solaris, Free BSD, Mac OS X, and
any Linux variant.  As a computer user and reader of this document, you
should know exactly what operating system you have.

<p>
The user's interaction with the operation system is through a set of
programs. The most widely used of these enable viewing the contents of
folders or starting other programs.  To interact with the operating
system, as a user, you can either issue commands in a terminal window
or use graphical programs. For example, for viewing the file contents
of a folder you can run the command <code>ls</code> in a Unix terminal window or
<code>dir</code> in a DOS (Windows) terminal window. The graphical alternatives
are many, some of the most common are Windows Explorer on Windows,
Nautilus and Konqueror on Unix, and Finder on Mac.  To start a
program, it is common to double-click on a file icon or write the
program's name in a terminal window.
